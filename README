ircbot
======================

Introduction
-------------------
This hobby project is a small and slick IRC bot framework 
with loadable module support written in plain C.

System Requirements
-------------------
- some kind of UNIX (neither written for Windows nor tested there)
- glib2.0

Getting Started
-------------------

To start the bot, just run 

./bot

configuration values are parsed from ircb.conf in the same folder.
To override config values for server and port, run:

./bot <IRC server> <port>

TODO
-------------------
- The plugin framework will get some more extensions
- Timer events for the plugins
