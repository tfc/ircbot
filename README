ircbot
======================

Introduction
-------------------
This hobby project is a small and slick IRC bot framework 
with loadable module support written in plain C.

System Requirements
-------------------
You need some kind of UNIX (the code doesn't compile under Windows) and glib2.0

Getting Started
-------------------

To start the bot, just run 

./bot <IRC server> <port>

TODO
-------------------
- Bot settings like user name etc. are still hardcoded --> make this configurable.
- The plugin framework will get some more extensions
- Timer events for the plugins
